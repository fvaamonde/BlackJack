# Simple Blackjack Game of Cards

This project emulates a casino game of blackjack using the deckofcardsapi by Chase Roberts for card images.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to [Chase Roberts](https://github.com/crobertsbmw) for providing the API ([deckofcardsapi](https://deckofcardsapi.com/)) which supplied the card images for this project.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development and can be improved. One feature that is planned for implementation is the ability to split cards when there are two of similar value.

## Usage

To get started with the game, from terminal node index.js

## Betting

In the current version of the emulator, bets are fixed at 10 points. Future updates may include the ability to customize bet amounts.
